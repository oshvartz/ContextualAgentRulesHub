# Active Context: ContextualAgentRulesHub

## Current Work Focus
**COMPLETED**: Successfully refactored the rule system from Rule to AgentRule with on-demand content loading and simplified in-memory repository architecture.

## Recent Changes
- ✅ Created `RuleContentSource` abstraction for on-demand content loading
- ✅ Refactored `Rule` → `AgentRule` with metadata-only approach
- ✅ Implemented `YamlFileContentSource` for YAML file support
- ✅ Created simplified `AgentRuleRepository` with in-memory dictionary storage
- ✅ Built `YamlRuleLoader` for populating repository from YAML files
- ✅ Successfully tested system with existing YAML rules (5 rules loaded)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Current Session)
1. ✅ Create comprehensive Memory Bank documentation
2. ✅ Add Python .gitignore file for proper development workflow
3. ✅ Establish basic Python project structure
4. ✅ Define MCP server interface requirements
5. ✅ Implement core entity models (AgentRule, RuleContentSource)
6. ✅ Create YAML source implementation
7. ✅ Build rule discovery and indexing system

### Short Term
1. Clean up old files (rule.py, old repository, sources)
2. Update any existing MCP interface to use new AgentRule system
3. Add comprehensive error handling improvements
4. Create more comprehensive testing framework

### Medium Term
1. Add rule validation system enhancements
2. Implement additional source types (Database, API, Git)
3. Add logging and monitoring
4. Performance optimizations for large rule sets

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made
- **AgentRule Architecture**: Successfully separated metadata from content
- **On-Demand Loading**: Implemented via RuleContentSource pattern
- **YAML-Only Support**: Focused implementation as requested
- **In-Memory Repository**: Simple dictionary-based storage for fast access
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new source types in future

### Refactoring Results
- **Memory Efficiency**: Content loaded only when needed
- **Performance**: Fast rule lookups via dictionary mapping
- **Simplicity**: Removed complex indexing and multi-source abstractions
- **Flexibility**: Easy to extend with new source types via RuleContentSource

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Metadata-First Design**: AgentRule contains only metadata fields
- **Lazy Loading**: Content loaded on-demand via `load_content()` method
- **YAML Structure**: Supports existing format (id, description, language, tags, rule)
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean separation between storage and business logic
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling for file operations

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Successful Implementation
- Loaded 5 existing rules successfully from YAML files
- On-demand content loading working correctly
- Repository queries (by tag, language, description) functioning
- Clean separation between metadata and content achieved

### System Capabilities Demonstrated
- **Rule Loading**: YAML files parsed and loaded into repository
- **Content Access**: On-demand loading from YAML files working
- **Filtering**: By tags, language, description search all functional
- **Memory Management**: Only metadata kept in memory until content needed

### Architecture Benefits
- **Scalable**: Can handle large numbers of rules efficiently
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new source types
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Fast**: Dictionary-based lookups for rule access

## Current Environment
- Windows 11 with PowerShell 7
- VS Code development environment
- Git version control with automation flags
- Memory Bank documentation system established
- **NEW**: Fully functional AgentRule system with YAML support
