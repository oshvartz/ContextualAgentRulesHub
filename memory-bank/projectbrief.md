# Project Brief: Contextual

## Overview
ContextualAgentRulesHub is a data model system for an MCP server that manages and retrieves agent rules based on task contexts. The system is designed to handle rule content stored in YAML files with support for language-specific rules and tag-based categorization.

## Core Requirements
1. Store and manage agent rules with their metadata
2. Support YAML file-based rule content storage
3. Enable rule retrieval based on language and tags
4. Provide extensible source system for future enhancements

## Goals
- Efficient rule organization and retrieval
- Flexible tagging system for rule categorization
- Support for language-specific rules
- Extensible architecture for future source types

## Scope
- YAML-based file source implementation
- Core entity models for rules and sources
